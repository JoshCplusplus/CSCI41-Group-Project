# CSCI41-Group-Project
CSCI 41 Group Project for Kerney's class. Spring 2018. 
Chemistry Simulation 
Keeps track of energy formed from your molecules that are created.
The .gch is a pre compiled header that makes compiling the .h faster.

The program works by entering in two atoms to create new molecules. When you create a new molecule, that new molecule can now be used to create other molecules(i.e use two H atoms to create H2 and then combine H2 and O to make H2O, water)

This Readme was definitely not updated during class
