Atom Simulator

Keeps track of energy formed from your molecules that are created.
The .gch is a pre compiled header that makes compiling the .h faster.

The program works by entering in two atoms to create new molecules. When you create a new molecule, that new molecule can now be used to create other molecules(i.e use two H atoms to create H2 and then combine H2 and O to make H2O, water)

One achievement I made during this program was I created an unordered map of pairs that hashed the pairs using the boost library.
